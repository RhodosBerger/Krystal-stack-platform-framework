## Executive Summary
This document establishes the competitive landscape for the FANUC RISE v2.1 system. By analyzing 6 competing algorithmic approaches, we establish baseline performance metrics that the "Shadow Council" agents must exceed.

## Comparative Matrix

| System / Algorithm | Core Logic | HW Platform | Performance Benchmark |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FANUC RISE v2.1** | **Metacognitive / Hybrid** | **Fanuc FOCAS / OpenVINO** | **Target: >20% Holistic Gain** |
| Non-linear GRG | Mathematical (GRG) | Multi-turret CNC | 60% (Simultaneous ops only) |
| Expert CNC System | Genetic Algorithms | Windows / VC++ | 18.63% Path Reduction |
| Splined Bezier | Curve Smoothing | 3-Axis NC | 1-9% (General), 75% (Ripples) |
| ANN / PSO | Predictive / Swarm | Solidworks / OpenVINO | 19% Pocket Milling |
| Neuro-C | Ternary Networks | Cortex-M0 (Edge) | 90% Latency Reduction |
| Evolution Strategies | "Death Penalty" Logic | CNC Milling | 2.82/min Profit Rate |

## Integration Strategy for Shadow Council

### 1. The Auditor (Logic & Safety)
* **Benchmark:** Must reject any "Optimization" that yields < 1% gain (based on Splined Bezier baseline).
* **Safety:** Uses "Evolution Strategies" logic (Death Penalty) for any solution that violates safety constraints.

### 2. The Biochemist (Efficiency)
* **Goal:** Beat the **18.63%** path reduction set by "Expert CNC".
* **Method:** Thermal-Biased Mutation (Dopamine).

### 3. The Observer (Vision)
* **Goal:** Match the **90% Latency Reduction** of Neuro-C by utilizing OpenVINO on edge devices.
