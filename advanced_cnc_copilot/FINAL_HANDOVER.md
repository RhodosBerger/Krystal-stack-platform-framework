# 🏆 MISSION COMPLETE: FANUC RISE v2.1 (Enterprise)

The "Advanced CNC Copilot" has been fully realized. Every phase of the 2026 Roadmap has been implemented, debugged, and integrated into a high-performance Multisite UI.

## 🚀 Final Accomplishments

### 1. 🧠 Distributed Brain (The Neural Core)
*   **Shadow Council Architecture**: Asynchronous auditing system that prevents safety violations before they reach the machine.
*   **Dopamine Engine**: Reinforcement learning system that adapts machine "personality" based on real-world outcomes.
*   **Vision Cortex**: Automated part inspection using simulated YOLOv8 computer vision.

### 2. 🎨 Multisite Interface (Scale-Creativity)
*   **Four Integrated Personas**:
    *   **OPERATOR**: Live shop-floor execution and telemetry.
    *   **MANAGER**: Fleet command, OEE analytics, and community marketplace.
    *   **CREATIVE**: Generative design, WebXR training, and robotics simulation.
    *   **ADMIN**: Root configuration and Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) health.
*   **Unified Token System**: Industrial/Neuro design language using Tailwind and Framer Motion.

### 3. 🔌 Hardware & Ecosystem
*   **FOCAS Bridge**: Direct connection to physical Fanuc CNCs (Hardware-Ready with DLL support).
*   **Extension Suite**: VS Code Neuro-Coder, Chrome Fleet Overlay, and Blender Creative Twin.
*   **Marketplace**: Functional community hub for sharing validated machining configurations.

## 🕹️ System Operation

1.  **Launch**: Run **`repair_and_launch.bat`** to start all services.
2.  **Access**: Use the **`TEST_LINKS.md`** magic links to enter the system as any role.
3.  **Explore**: Try out the **VR Training** in the Creative Studio or the **Swarm Map** in the Manager Dashboard.
