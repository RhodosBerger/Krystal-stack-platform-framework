# Monetization Article: Productizing Cognitive CNC Intelligence

## Executive Thesis

FANUC RISE can be monetized as a layered product where deterministic safety and measurable manufacturing outcomes are the core value drivers. The commercial strategy should package value by **risk reduction**, **throughput improvement**, and **fleet learning effects**.

## 1) Monetizable Value Units

### A. Safety Assurance Unit
- Includes deterministic auditor policy packs, reason-code traceability, and safety regression suites.
- Buyer value: reduced incident risk and better auditability.

### B. Productivity Unit
- Includes optimization proposals, adaptive strategy ranking, and cycle-time analytics.
- Buyer value: improved throughput and lower setup waste.

### C. Fleet Intelligence Unit
- Includes multi-machine telemetry orchestration, cross-site learning propagation, and fleet dashboards.
- Buyer value: standardized best practices and lower variance across plants.

## 2) Packaging Model

### Community (Entry)
- Core dashboard and simulation workflows.
- Basic safety policies.
- Single-site mode.

### Professional (Growth)
- Advanced auditor policy bundles.
- Fleet-wide dashboards and machine-scoped telemetry controls.
- Dataset export for simulator-based training.

### Enterprise (Scale)
- Multi-site tenancy + RBAC.
- SLA-backed integrations and compliance reporting.
- Decision trace archival and release-readiness policy gates.

## 3) Revenue Architecture

- **Subscription**: per site, per machine, or hybrid.
- **Usage add-on**: premium analytics compute and long-term trace retention.
- **Services**: rollout, policy tuning, simulator calibration.
- **Partner channel**: OEM/system integrator deployment bundles.

## 4) Pricing Anchors (Outcome-Based)

Use outcome anchors instead of feature-only pricing:
- Downtime prevented per month.
- Scrap/rework reduction.
- Cycle-time savings per part family.
- Operator ramp-up time reduction.

## 5) Go-to-Market Sequencing

1. Start with simulation-first pilot (low-risk proof).
2. Transition to shadow mode in live plants.
3. Expand to deterministic guarded execution in constrained operations.
4. Scale to multi-site with policy standardization and ROI dashboarding.

## 6) Commercial Risks and Controls

- **Risk**: overpromising AI autonomy.
  - **Control**: enforce deterministic safety-first positioning.
- **Risk**: long enterprise sales cycles.
  - **Control**: pilot templates with measurable 6–12 week KPIs.
- **Risk**: integration friction.
  - **Control**: bootstrap + architecture docs + reference runbooks.

## 7) KPI Set for Monetization Health

- Pilot conversion rate.
- Net revenue retention (NRR).
- Payback period by plant.
- Gross margin by deployment tier.
- Support ticket rate per deployed machine.
