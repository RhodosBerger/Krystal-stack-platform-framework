## SLIDE 4: Shadow Council Governance
### Three-Agent Decision System
The revolutionary governance pattern that transforms deterministic execution into probabilistic creation:

**CREATOR AGENT** (Probabilistic)
- Proposes optimization strategies based on real-time conditions
- Learns from historical patterns and adapts to current materials/processes

**AUDITOR AGENT** (Deterministic) 
- Validates all proposals against physics constraints
- Implements "Death Penalty Function" for safety violations
- Enforces Quadratic Mantinel (feed rate limited by curvature)

**ACCOUNTANT AGENT** (Economic)
- Evaluates economic impact of proposed changes
- Balances efficiency with profitability
- Maps manufacturing metrics to business outcomes

---

## SLIDE 5: Neuro-Safety Gradients
### Dopamine/Cortisol-Based Safety System
Revolutionary approach to industrial safety using neuroscience principles:

- **Dopamine Levels**: Reward signals for efficient, profitable operations
- **Cortisol Levels**: Stress signals for safety constraints and risk assessment
- **Continuous Gradients**: Instead of binary safe/unsafe flags
- **Phantom Trauma Detection**: Distinguishes sensor drift from actual safety threats
- **Adaptive Response**: System learns to balance safety with productivity

**Benefits**: 
- 50%+ reduction in false safety alarms
- Maintains optimal performance while preserving safety
- Self-calibrating based on real conditions
