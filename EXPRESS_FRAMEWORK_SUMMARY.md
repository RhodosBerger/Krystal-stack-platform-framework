# Express Settings Framework - Project Summary

## Overview
This project implements an Express Settings Framework that allows rapid combination of features from different components (Guardian Framework, Grid Memory Controller, Essential Encoder, GAMESA Tweaker) using a plugin-based architecture.

## Key Components Integrated

### 1. Guardian Framework
- CPU Governor for performance management
- Memory Hierarchy Manager for resource allocation
- Trigonometric Optimizer for pattern recognition
- Hexadecimal System for resource trading
- Fibonacci Escalator for parameter optimization

### 2. Grid Memory Controller
- 3D Grid Memory Management with coordinate system
- Memory tier allocation (L1/L2/L3 cache, VRAM, RAM, etc.)
- Coherence protocol for data consistency
- Migration engine for optimization
- Functional Runtime for operations

### 3. Essential Encoder
- Multiple encoding strategies (Binary, Base64, JSON, Compressed, Neural, Hex)
- Neural Network optimized encoding
- Quantized encoding for efficiency
- Data integrity verification

### 4. GAMESA Tweaker Subsystem
- OpenVINO preset management
- Automatic switching based on telemetry
- Credible rule engine for decision making
- Qualitative computing modes

## Framework Architecture

### Core Components
